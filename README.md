# ML_Methods_ActivityRecognition_IMU
ML methods for activity recognition after LDA, PCA using SVM and CNN for comparison

Classify human activities using IMU acceleration and gyro signals using NN
- Matlab files are extract transfer function features for ML
- Classify brute uses raw data
- Classify DT_TF uses a Decision Tree on the transfer funciton extracted data
- Classify mode uses mathematical mode between different features
- Classify mode w foot uses foot IMU signals instead of chest 
- w PCA and w LDA files implement PCA and LDA feature selection to improve the results
